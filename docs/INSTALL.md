INSTALL
===============================================================================

Install on RedHat / CentOS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**This is the recommended way to install the extension**


0. Add the [PostgreSQL Official RPM Repo] to your system. It shouldb be something like:

```console
$ sudo yum install https://.../pgdg-redhat-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

[PostgreSQL Official RPM Repo]: https://yum.postgresql.org/

1. Install 

```console
$ sudo yum install postgresql12-contrib postgresql_anonymizer12
```

(Replace `12` with the major version of your PostgreSQL instance.)

2. Add 'anon' in the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter of you `postgresql.conf` file. For example:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements, anon'
```

3. Restart your instance. 

Install With [PGXN](https://pgxn.org/) :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Install the extension on the server with:

```console
$ sudo apt install pgxnclient postgresql-server-dev-12
$ sudo pgxn install ddlx
$ sudo pgxn install postgresql_anonymizer
```

(Replace `12` with the major version of your PostgreSQL instance.)

2. Add 'anon' in the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter of you `postgresql.conf` file. For example:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements, anon'
```

3. Restart your instance. 


**Additional notes:**

* PGXN can also be installed with `pip install pgxn`
* If you have several versions of PostgreSQL installed on your system, 
  you may have to point to the right version with the `--pg_config` 
  parameter.
* Check out the [pgxn install documentation] for more information.

Install From source
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. First you need to install the postgresql development libraries. On most
distribution, this is available through a package called `postgresql-devel`
or `postgresql-server-dev`.

1. Build the project like any other PostgreSQL extension:

```console
$ make extension
$ sudo make install
```

2. Add 'anon' in the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter of you `postgresql.conf` file. For example:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements, anon'
```

3. Restart your instance. 


Install in the cloud
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally Database As A Service operators ( such as Amazon RDS ) do not allow 
their clients to load any extension. Instead they support only a limited subset 
of extensions, such as PostGIS or pgcrypto. You can ask them if they plan to 
support this one in the near future, but you shouldn't bet your life on it ðŸ˜ƒ

However this tool is set of plpgsql functions, which means should you be able to
install it directly without declaring an extension.

Here's a few steps to try it out:

```console
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/dalibo/postgresql_anonymizer.git
$ make standalone
$ psql ..... -f anon_standalone_PG11.sql
```

_NB_ : Replace `PG11` with the version of Postgres offered by your DBaaS operator.

In this situation, you will have to declare the masking rules with COMMENT
instead of security labels. See [Declaring Rules with COMMENTs] for more details.

[Declaring Rules with COMMENTs]: declare_masking_rules.md#declaring-rules-with-comments 

When you activate the masking engine, you need to disable `autoload`:

```sql
SELECT anon.start_dynamic_masking( autoload := FALSE );
```
