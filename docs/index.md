Anonymization & Data Masking for PostgreSQL
===============================================================================

`postgresql_anonymizer` is an extension to mask or replace
[personally identifiable information] (PII) or commercially sensitive data from
a PostgreSQL database.

The projet has a **declarative approach** of anonymization. This means you can 
[declare the masking rules] using the PostgreSQL Data Definition Language (DDL) 
and specify your anonymization strategy inside the table definition itself.

Once the maskings rules are defined, you can access the anonymized data in 3  
different ways :

* [Anonymous Dumps] : Simply export the masked data into an SQL file
* [In-Place Anonymization] : Remove the PII according to the rules
* [Dynamic Masking] : Hide PII only for the masked users

In addition, various [Masking Functions] are available : randomization, faking,
partial scrambling, shufflin, noise or even your own custom function !

Beyond masking, it is also possible to use [Generalization] and [k-anonymity] 
functions, which are perfect for analytics data.

Finally the extension offers a panel of [detection] functions that will try to 
guess which columns needs to be anonymized.

Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```sql
=# SELECT * FROM people;
 id | fistname | lastname |   phone    
----+----------+----------+------------
 T1 | Sarah    | Conor    | 0609110911
```

Step 1 : Activate the dynamic masking engine

```sql
=# CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS anon CASCADE;
=# SELECT anon.start_dynamic_masking();
```

Step 2 : Declare a masked user

```sql
=# CREATE ROLE skynet LOGIN;
=# SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON ROLE skynet IS 'MASKED';
```

Step 3 : Declare the masking rules

```sql
=# SECURITY LABEL FOR anonON COLUMN people.lastname 
-# IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.fake_last_name()';

=# SECURITY LABEL FOR anon ON COLUMN people.phone 
-# IS 'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.partial(phone,2,$$******$$,2)';
```

Step 4 : Connect with the masked user

```sql
=# \! psql peopledb -U skynet -c 'SELECT * FROM people;'
 id | fistname | lastname  |   phone    
----+----------+-----------+------------
 T1 | Sarah    | Stranahan | 06******11
```
